#### Ocean Adventure 

Terminal-based adventure-survival-exploration game   

Building this game gave me further/deeper experience with C++ and object-oriented-programming as well as basic game design and mechanics such as game probabilities and random event implementation.

Primary features:  
- You're lost at sea. Explore an ocean map with islands and try to survive until you're rescued
- Fish for a variety of sea creatures in water, or search for resources like water and wood on land
- Find coins to upgrade your boat to improve its performance and catch larger animals
- Eat animals you catch to replenish your health
- Survive for as many days as you can without running out of health or water
- Encounter random events like storms and sharks
- Learn about animals you might encounter
- Keep track of your food and supplies in your inventory
- Save your score and view previous scores

How to run:  
- Compile: run 'make build'  
- Run: ./a.out

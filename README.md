# ocean exploration

terminal-based exploration/adventure/survival game  
developing this game gave me experience with C++ as well as basic game design and mechanics such as game probabilities/random events.

**compile**: g++ -std=c++20 Game.cpp Inventory.cpp Player.cpp Map.cpp Boat.cpp Animal.cpp main.cpp    
**run**: ./a.out

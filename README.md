# ocean adventure

Text/terminal-based exploration/adventure game  
This game helped me learn the basics of C++ as well as basic game design and mechanics such as game probabilities.

To run, first compile: g++ -std=c++17 Game.cpp Inventory.cpp Player.cpp Map.cpp Boat.cpp Animal.cpp main.cpp, then run using: ./a.out

Future improvement ideas:

# ocean adventure

Compile (all files must be in same directory): g++ -std=c++11 Game.cpp Inventory.cpp Player.cpp Map.cpp Boat.cpp Animal.cpp project3.cpp  
Run: ./a.out


Ideas for future improvements:  
-allow player to start from a saved game  
-allow player to set map size  
-verify cross-platform visibility

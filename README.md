# ocean exploration

## Terminal-based exploration/adventure/survival game 

**Building this game gave me experience with C++ as well as basic game design and mechanics such as game probabilities and random events.**

### Primary features:
- You are lost at sea!
- Take control of a boat and explore an ocean map with islands as you try to survive until you're rescued.
- Fish for a variety of sea creatures in water, or search for resources like water and wood on land.
  - Actions are implemented with a degree of randomness to simulate the real world situation
- Find coins to upgrade your boat to improve its performance and catch larger animals
- Eat the animals you catch to replenish your health
- Survive for as many days as you can without running out of health or water
- Encounter random events like storms and sharks that hurt you
- Learn about the animals you might encounter
- Keep track of your food and supplies in your inventory
- Save your score and view previous scores
- And more!
